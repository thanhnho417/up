00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.700
The bathhouse is closed today
Thank you for your understanding

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.040
We're the same, right? Our walking pace

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.790
I wonder if it matches

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.240
Wait for me, because I want to walk slowly

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.800
Looking at the night sky, just talking

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.510
It's good, right? Because it cleared up today

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.000
Isn't it nice, even though it's trivial?

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.290
Sometimes crying, sometimes laughing

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.920
I love the days with you

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.090
In the corner of the night, the two of us tightly

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.180
Attracted to each other, over and over

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.650
When we kiss each other good night
and close our eyes

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.800
The future begins again

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.360
Nice to meet you again

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.520
